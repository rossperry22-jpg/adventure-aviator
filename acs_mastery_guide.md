# ACS Mastery: The Precision Standard

## 1. The Magnitude of Tolerances
The Airman Certification Standards (ACS) are not suggestions. They are the hard boundaries between a student and a Pilot in Command.

## 2. Steep Turns (The +/- 100ft Rule)
- **The Maneuver**: 45 degrees of bank.
- **The Magnitude**: Maintain altitude within 100 feet.
- **The Suave Secret**: Visual lead. Don't chase the needle; lead the horizon.

## 3. Short-Field Landings (The Aiming Point)
- **The Standard**: Land within 200 feet of the specified point.
- **The Execution**: Stabilized approach. If the energy isn't right, go around. Magnitude is judgment.

## 4. Heading Control (+/- 10 Degrees)
- **The Focus**: Small corrections. Large movements create noise. Suave pilots use fingertips.
