# Radio Professionalism: The Suave Aviator's Guide

## 1. The Magnitude of Communication
Communication is not just about talking; it's about being 10 miles ahead of the airplane. Clear, concise, and predictable.

## 2. The Four Ws (The Foundation)
1. **Who** you are calling (e.g., Greenville Tower).
2. **Who** you are (Cessna 123AB).
3. **Where** you are (5 miles South at 2,500ft).
4. **What** you want (Inbound for landing with Information Alpha).

## 3. Class D Operations
- **The Initial Call**: Establish two-way communication before entering the cylinder.
- **The Phrase**: "Greenville Tower, Cessna 172SP, 10 miles South, 3,000, landing with Bravo."
- **The Response**: If they say your tail number, you are cleared to enter.

## 4. Class C & B: The Suave Approach
- **Approach Control**: Always start with a "Cold Call" for flight following.
- **The Script**: "Greer Approach, Cessna 123AB, VFR Request."
- **Squawk Code**: Input immediately. Magnitude is speed.

## 5. Non-Towered (CTAF)
- **Position Reports**: Be the "Director" of the pattern.
- **The Script**: "Greenville Downtown Traffic, Cessna 123AB, Left Downwind Runway 01, Full Stop, Greenville Downtown."

## 6. The "Suave" Vocabulary
- **Affirmative** (Yes)
- **Negative** (No)
- **Wilco** (I will comply)
- **Roger** (I received your last transmission)
- **Standby** (I am busy, wait)
